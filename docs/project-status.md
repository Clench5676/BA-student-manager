## Review artifact and validation

`dist/Blue-Archive-Modding-and-Patching-Tool-0.6.0-alpha.8-macos-arm64.dmg`, MD5 `b0b29840c21c55190aa3052dd814a7e1`,
built from `d932f9f6` (`chore(release): 0.6.0-alpha.8`).

On `main` before the build: 1,885 JavaScript tests passed; 3,076 Python tests passed, 26 skipped (with the official
development view). Native Windows behavior is not verified on the macOS host; BL-037's native behaviour needs owner
acceptance on both platforms.
